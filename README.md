# RemoteMediatr
## This project is a work in progress.

This library is targeted at Blazor WebAssembly and will allow you to send Mediatr requests over http without needing to add any extra boilerplate/controllers.
Requests from your frontend are sent to an endpoint on your server which handles all of the Mediatr logic without any controllers.
